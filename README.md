## ðŸš¦ Quick Start

Below is a quick start guide on how to use the `Typography` component in a simple React app, with Typescript.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import { ThemeProvider, Typography } from "@playpickup/core";

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <div>
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Typography variant="title">PlayPickUp!</Typography>
    </ThemeProvider>
  </div>
);

const el = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, el);
```

> Be sure to include `ThemeProvider` in your application. ThemeProvider should be included as far up the component tree as possible.
