A collection of packages that make up the PickUp component universe.

## üíæ Installation

```sh
yarn add @playpickup/core @playpickup/icons

## or if npm is your jam

npm install @playpickup/core @playpickup/icons --save
```

## üö¶ Quick Start

Below is a quick start guide on how to use the `Typography` component in a simple React app, with Typescript.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import { ThemeProvider, Typography } from "@playpickup/core";

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <div>
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Typography variant="title">PlayPickUp!</Typography>
    </ThemeProvider>
  </div>
);

const el = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, el);
```

> Be sure to include `ThemeProvider` in your application. ThemeProvider should be included as far up the component tree as possible.

## üë®üèæ‚Äçüé® Using @playpickup/core to style your App

`@playpickup/core` uses [react-jss](https://cssinjs.org/react-jss/?v=v10.7.1) under the hood to style the components. We include these core methods in our package so you don't have to also include `react-jss` in your project. Below is an example of how you would use `core` to style a component. In this example, `<ThemeProvider>` is used at the top level of the application.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { ThemeProvider, createUseStyles, DefaultTheme } from "@playpickup/core";

const useStyles = createUseStyles((theme: DefaultTheme) => ({
  root: {
    display: "flex",
    position: "relative",
    backgroundColor: "red",
    color: theme.colors.primary,  // you can access default theme styles like so
    fontSize: 46,
    borderRadius: theme.borderRadius,
    padding: theme.spacing.base * 2, // double the base spacing size FANCY EYYY?
  },
}));

const SuperStyledDiv: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  const classes = useStyles();
  return(
    <div className={classes.root}>{children}</div>;
  )
};

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <SuperStyledDiv>
        I'm super styled!
      </SuperStyledDiv>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```
